\section{Performance measurements}

The version used were \emph{spexs2.1.1@f1d6f7 (spexs2)} compiled with \emph{go1.1rc3} and \emph{spexs.0.2.a01}.

Unfortunately I was unable to run \emph{spexs} with large datasets 5e6 protein sequences.

The original \emph{spexs} works faster in 1 thread case which is to be expected due to 
runtime and language differences.
